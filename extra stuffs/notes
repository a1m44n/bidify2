/*
in user models look at role schema. there are 3 roles; seller, buyer, and admin.
in report, plan to only use 2 which are buyer and seller


look at commision balance schema


in routes>userRoute.js look at 
    const { protect, isAdmin } = require("../middleware/authMiddleware");
    it is either authMiddleware or authMiddleWare 


external libraries used - multer, bcrypt


function below get all products by all users instead of only admin 
    const getAllProductsByAdmin = asyncHandler(async (req, res) => {
        const products = await Product.find({}).sort("-createdAt").populate("user");

        res.json(products);
    });


Look at files in models folder. Make sure naming is consistent.
